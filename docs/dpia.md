- **Data Processing**: Smartphone sensor data → behavioral features → risk scores → pricing adjustments
- **Geographic Scope**: Single regional demonstration (expandable)
- **Population**: Voluntary insurance customers (18+ years, valid drivers)

### System Components
1. **Data Collection**: Smartphone app collecting GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Monthly aggregation of driving behaviors 
3. **Risk Modeling**: ML models (GLM + LightGBM) predicting loss cost
4. **Pricing Engine**: Risk-adjusted premium calculations with caps/smoothing
5. **Customer Dashboard**: Transparent risk factor explanations

## Legal Basis for Processing

### Primary Legal Basis
**Article 6(1)(a) GDPR - Consent**
- **Explicit Opt-In**: Users must actively consent to telematics data collection
- **Granular Consent**: Separate consent for collection, profiling, and premium adjustment
- **Withdrawable**: Users can withdraw consent at any time with 30-day notice period

### Secondary Legal Basis
**Article 6(1)(b) GDPR - Contract Performance**
- **Legitimate Interest**: Risk assessment necessary for insurance contract fulfillment
- **Proportionality**: Data processing proportionate to insurance risk assessment needs
- **Balancing Test**: Business interests balanced against individual privacy rights

### Special Category Data
**Article 9(2)(a) GDPR - Explicit Consent** (where applicable)
- **Location Data**: Precise location potentially reveals sensitive information
- **Behavioral Profiling**: Driving patterns may infer health, lifestyle characteristics
- **Enhanced Consent**: Additional explicit consent for any special category implications

## Data Minimization & Processing Principles

### Data Collection Minimization

#### **Collected Data**
✅ **GPS Coordinates**: For speed limit determination and road type classification  
✅ **Accelerometer**: For harsh braking/acceleration detection  
✅ **Gyroscope**: For lateral movement and cornering behavior  
✅ **Timestamp**: For night driving and temporal pattern analysis  

#### **Deliberately Excluded**
❌ **Audio/Video**: No recording of conversations or visual data  
❌ **Precise Location**: GPS coordinates immediately converted to coarse geohash  
❌ **Detailed Routes**: Specific trip origins/destinations not stored  
❌ **Passenger Data**: No collection of passenger information or behavior  

### Geographic Privacy Protection
- **Coarse Geohashing**: GPS coordinates rounded to ~1km precision grid cells
- **Regional Aggregation**: Location analysis at county/regional level only
- **Home/Work Inference**: Algorithms specifically avoid inferring sensitive locations
- **Route Anonymization**: Trip paths not reconstructed or stored

### Temporal Aggregation
- **Real-Time Processing**: Raw sensor data processed immediately, not stored
- **Monthly Summaries**: Only aggregated behavioral statistics retained
- **Statistical Noise**: Small random variations added to prevent precise reconstruction
