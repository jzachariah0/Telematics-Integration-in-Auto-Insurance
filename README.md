## Risk Features

The platform analyzes **16 comprehensive risk factors**:

### Core Driving Behaviors
- **Harsh Events**: Braking, acceleration, and lateral movement rates per 100 miles
- **Speeding**: Percentage of time speeding >5, >10, >15 mph over limit
- **Driving Volatility**: 95th percentile jerk measurements

### Environmental Factors
- **Night Driving**: Percentage of nighttime driving (higher risk)
- **Wet Weather**: Percentage of driving in wet conditions
- **Road Types**: Highway vs. arterial vs. local road exposure

### Contextual Risk Factors 
- **Crash Density Index**: External crash frequency data by location and road type
- **Theft Risk Index**: Vehicle theft probability based on geographic area

### Usage Metrics
- **Miles Driven**: Total monthly mileage
- **Trip Count**: Number of individual trips

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### GLM (Generalized Linear Model)
- **Purpose**: Base risk modeling with interpretable coefficients
- **Features**: All 16 risk factors with polynomial transformations
- **Output**: Continuous risk scores for premium calculation

### LightGBM (Gradient Boosting)
- **Purpose**: Advanced pattern recognition and non-linear relationships
- **Features**: Enhanced feature engineering with interaction terms
- **Output**: Probability distributions for claims frequency/severity

### SHAP Integration
- **Explainability**: Every prediction includes top 5 risk factor explanations
- **Transparency**: Both technical and plain English descriptions
- **Regulatory**: Meets insurance transparency requirements

## Pricing Engine

The pricing system implements industry-standard practices:

1. **Base Premium**: $100/month starting point
2. **Risk Index**: Calculated from 16 features using trained models
3. **Telematics Factor**: Risk-based multiplier (0.7x - 1.3x range)
4. **Regulatory Caps**: 
   - Monthly: ±10% adjustment limit
   - Quarterly: ±25% adjustment limit
   - First Month: Grace period with minimal adjustment

### Formula
```
Final Premium = Base Premium × min(Telematics Factor, Regulatory Caps)
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Interactive dashboard
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `GET /api/pricing` - Pricing data for all users

## Data Pipeline

1. **Raw Data**: Simulated telematics trips with GPS, speed, and behavior events
2. **Feature Engineering**: 16 features extracted per user per month
3. **External Data**: Crash density and theft risk indices added
4. **Model Training**: GLM + LightGBM ensemble on historical data
5. **SHAP Analysis**: Reason codes generated for every prediction
6. **Pricing**: Risk-based premiums with regulatory compliance
7. **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization and explanations

## Regulatory Compliance

- **Transparency**: SHAP explanations for every risk assessment
- **Rate Caps**: Regulatory limits on premium adjustments
- **Fair Pricing**: Equal treatment with explainable risk factors
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymized user identifiers
- **Audit Trail**: Complete lineage from raw data to final premium

## Development
