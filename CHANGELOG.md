### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### Data Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: 16 sophisticated telematics features
  - Driving patterns (trip frequency, duration distributions)
  - Speed behavior (percentiles, acceleration patterns) 
  - Temporal risk factors (night driving, weekend patterns)
  - Geographic risk (urban/rural, high-risk areas)

#### Model Architecture
- **GLM (Generalized Linear Model)**: Baseline interpretable model
- **LightGBM**: Advanced gradient boosting for accuracy
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines interpretability with performance
- **SHAP Integration**: Comprehensive model explainability

#### Production Features
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with automatic documentation
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data processing and model inference
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics

---

### 📊 **Model Performance**
- **Training Data**: ~50,000 telematics records
- **Validation**: 20% holdout with temporal splitting
- **Feature Selection**: SHAP-based importance ranking
- **Calibration**: Well-calibrated probability estimates
- **Lift**: Strong discrimination across risk deciles
