```

#### **Data Pipeline Architecture**
```
Real-Time Flow:
Mobile App → API Gateway → Kinesis → Lambda → Feature Store → ML Models → Pricing Engine

Batch Processing:
S3 Raw Data → EMR Spark → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Registry → Deployment
```

#### **Deployment Strategy**
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime model updates
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new ML models
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible environments
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitOps with automated testing and deployment

### Security & Compliance

#### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Data Minimization**: Automated retention and deletion policies
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with MFA

#### **Compliance Framework**
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data subject rights and consent management
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **Insurance Regulatory**: State-specific compliance monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity tracking and forensics

### Monitoring & Observability

#### **Application Monitoring**
- **APM**: Datadog/New Relic for application performance
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana for custom business metrics
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical incidents

#### **ML Model Monitoring**
- **Model Drift Detection**: Statistical tests for feature and prediction drift
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time accuracy and bias detection
- **A/B Testing**: Champion/challenger model comparison
- **Explainability Tracking**: SHAP value distribution monitoring

### Scalability Planning

#### **Traffic Patterns**
- **Peak Load**: 10,000 concurrent users, 100,000 API calls/minute
- **Data Volume**: 1TB/month telematics data, 10M predictions/day
- **Geographic**: Multi-region deployment for latency optimization

#### **Auto-Scaling Configuration**
```yaml
API Service:
  min_capacity: 2
  max_capacity: 50
  target_cpu: 70%
  scale_out_cooldown: 300s

ML Pipeline:
  min_capacity: 1
  max_capacity: 10
  target_memory: 80%
  batch_size: adaptive
```

### Cost Optimization

#### **Resource Management**
- **Spot Instances**: Use for batch processing and model training
- **Reserved Instances**: For predictable baseline workloads
- **Serverless**: Lambda for event-driven processing
- **Data Tiering**: Automated S3 lifecycle policies

#### **Estimated Monthly Costs (Production Scale)**
```
Compute (ECS + Lambda):     $2,500
Storage (RDS + S3):         $1,200
Data Processing (EMR):      $800
Monitoring & Security:      $600
Data Transfer:              $400
Total Estimated:            $5,500/month
```

### Disaster Recovery

#### **Backup Strategy**
- **Database**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention
- **Models**: Version-controlled artifacts in S3 with cross-region replication
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure state backup and recovery procedures

#### **Business Continuity**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Automatic failover for database and compute
- **Cross-Region**: Hot standby for mission-critical components

### Development Workflow

#### **Environment Strategy**
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓          ↓
   Local      AWS Dev    AWS Prod
   SQLite     RDS Test   RDS Prod
   Mock API   Test API   Prod API
```

#### **CI/CD Pipeline**
1. **Code Commit** → GitHub webhook
2. **Automated Tests** → Unit, integration, model validation
3. **Security Scan** → Dependency check, SAST/DAST
4. **Build & Package** → Docker images, model artifacts
5. **Deploy to Staging** → Automated deployment and smoke tests
6. **Production Deploy** → Manual approval gate + blue-green deployment
