# Dashboard Module

The InsurityAI dashboard is implemented as a FastAPI web application with server-side rendering located in `src/api/`. This module directory is reserved for future frontend framework implementations (React, Vue, etc.) if needed for enhanced interactivity.

## Current Implementation
- **Location**: `src/api/server.py` 
- **Technology**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates
- **Features**: Risk assessment, premium calculation, SHAP explanations, trend visualization

## Future Considerations
- Single-page application (SPA) for enhanced user experience
- Real-time updates and WebSocket integration
- Advanced charting and visualization libraries
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
